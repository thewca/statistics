## Miscellaneous

This part is intended for you to generate statistics virtually in any language. You create your data using the standard described [here](http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui/index.html#/statistics-controller-impl/createStatisticsUsingPOST), run the server project and post to `http://localhost:8080/statistics/create`.

_Note_: For SQL, you can use the resource folder in the server project, which is probably easier, but you can use your favorite language to query the database and post to that link anyways.
